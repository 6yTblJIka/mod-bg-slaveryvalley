- There are three bases: **Mine, Restless Graveyard, Prison**.
- Restless Graveyard and Mine give you the **Spirit Healer** of the base.
- **Mine**, if taken, buffs the team with **Mine Buff**, it increases your damage by 5%.
- **Restless Graveyard**, if taken, buffs the team with **Restless Soul Graveyard Buff**, it increases your stamina.
- If you **kill a player** you inflict 1 point to the opposite faction, if you **take Prison** you inflict 2 points when you kill a player.
- The base Prison has no graveyard.
- There are two bosses one for each faction.
- When you kill a boss inflict 10 points to the opposite faction, if you took all the bases, when you kill the boss you inflict 25 points to the opposite faction.
- If one of the two bosses die, the other boss disappear.
- The bosses (re)spawn after 5 minutes.
